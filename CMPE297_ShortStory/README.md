# **Short Story Assignment - AutoML: A Survey of the State-of-the-Art**

Discusses different stages in AutoML and the various approaches of AutoML for each. 

It provides an overview of state-of-the-art (SOTA) in AutoML. We will learn about the different AutoML processes including data preparation, feature engineering, hyperparameter optimization, and neural architecture search (NAS). We will also understand the NAS algorithmsâ€™ components and their performance on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The goal is to enable even beginners to get introduced to AutoML.
